# Form 4 Insider Trading

The federal securities laws require certain individuals
(such as officers, directors, and those that hold more
than 10% of any class of a company’s securities, together
we’ll call, “insiders”) to report purchases, sales, and
holdings of their company’s securities by filing Forms
3, 4, and 5.

## Form3

**What’s a Form 3?**
When a person becomes an insider (for example, when
they are hired as an officer or director), they must file a
Form 3 to initially disclose his or her ownership of the
company’s securities. Form 3 must be filed within 10
days after the person becomes an insider.

## Form 4

**What’s a Form 4?**

In most cases, when an insider executes a transaction,
he or she must file a Form 4. With this form filing, the
public is made aware of the insider’s various transactions
in company securities, including the amount purchased
or sold and the price per share. Form 4 must be filed
within two business days following the transaction date.
Transactions in a company’s common stock as well as
derivative securities, such as options, warrants, and
convertible securities, are reported on the form. Each
transaction is coded to indicate the nature of the
transaction.

## Form 5

**What’s a Form 5?**

A Form 5 is generally due to the SEC no later than 45
days after the company’s fiscal year ends and is only
required from an insider when at least one transaction,
because of an exemption or failure to earlier report,
was not reported during the year. For example, some
transactions, such as certain purchases by an insider of
less than $10,000 in a six-month period, don’t have to
be reported on Form 4 when they occur but do have
to be reported on Form 5. The Form 5 filing doesn’t
have to disclose transactions that have been previously
reported. When reporting transactions on Form 5,
insiders use the same transaction codes as when
reporting on Form 4.

>Hint: We do not care about form 5 for now.
